<!-- Quick bit of info about me -->
          <p>Hello, my name is Andrew Kehr. I'm a software developer living in Madison Wisconsin. Currently I am a student at Thinkful working on software engineering.</p>
          <p>I have always had an interest in math and programming and I finally have an opportunity to explore that. I have a lot of projects I want to work on and the education I receive from Thinkful will allow me to explore them.</p>
          <p>Outside of software development I am passionate about blacksmithing and metalcraft.  As with software development I love to watch a piece develop in my hands, shaping and forming it into something beautiful that will be appreciated.  Here are a few things that the creative smithing process has taught me:
            <ol>
              <li>Iterative process improvement</li>
              <li>Creating multiple designs</li>
              <li>Designing for others, not myself</li>
            </ol>
          <p> With that in mind, I would love to collaborate with others in order to provide an exceptional product.</p>
