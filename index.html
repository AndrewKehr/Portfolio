          <p>Hello, my name is Andrew Kehr. I'm a software developer living in Madison Wisconsin. Currently I am a student at Thinkful working on software engineering.</p>
          <p>I have always had an interest in math and programming and I finally have an opportunity to explore that. I have a lot of projects I want to work on and the education I receive from Thinkful will allow me to explore them.  Collaboration with other developers with similar ideas would be great.</p>
          <p>Outside of software development I am passionate about blacksmithing and metalcraft.  As with software development I love to watch a piece develop in my hands, shaping and forming it into something beautiful that will be appreciated.  The iterative design improvement process satisfies my need for continual improvement.
